**1. What are the main features introduced in Java 8?**

**Answer:** Java 8 introduced features such as lambda expressions, the Stream API, default and static methods in interfaces, the java.time package for date and time, and the new java.util.function package for functional programming constructs.

**2. What is a lambda expression in Java 8?**

**Answer:** A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function in Java. It allows you to define a method implementation inline, making your code more readable and expressive.

**3. What is the functional interface in Java 8?**

**Answer:** A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. They are used to represent lambda expressions or method references. Java 8 introduced the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to mark such interfaces.

**4. Explain the Stream API in Java 8.**

**Answer:** The Stream API in Java 8 is used for processing sequences of elements, such as collections or arrays, in a functional-style manner. It allows you to perform operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing on data elements.

**5. How do you create a Stream in Java 8?**

**Answer:** You can create a Stream from a collection using the `stream()` method or from an array using `Arrays.stream()`. Additionally, you can create an infinite Stream using methods like `Stream.generate()` or `Stream.iterate()`.

**6. What is a method reference in Java 8?**

**Answer:** A method reference is a shorthand notation for invoking a method using a lambda expression. It allows you to reuse existing method implementations in functional interfaces.

**7. What is the difference between `forEach` and `map` in the Stream API?**

**Answer:** `forEach` is used for performing an action on each element of a Stream, while `map` is used for transforming each element of a Stream and returning a new Stream of transformed elements.

**8. Explain the concept of a default method in an interface in Java 8.**

**Answer:** A default method in an interface is a method with a default implementation. It allows you to add new methods to an interface without breaking existing implementations.

**9. How does Java 8 handle date and time?**

**Answer:** Java 8 introduced the `java.time` package, which provides classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime` for representing date and time. It also includes utilities for formatting and parsing.

**10. What is a functional interface in Java, and why is it important in Java 8?**

**Answer:** A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method. It is important in Java 8 because it enables the use of lambda expressions and method references. It defines the contract for these functional constructs.

**11. What are the main differences between `HashSet` and `LinkedHashSet` in Java 8?**

**Answer:** `HashSet` is an unordered collection, while `LinkedHashSet` maintains the order of insertion. `LinkedHashSet` uses a doubly-linked list to maintain the order.

**12. How does the `Comparator` interface work with the `sort` method in Java 8?**

**Answer:** The `Comparator` interface is used to define custom sorting logic. You can pass a `Comparator` to the `sort` method to sort elements in a specific order.

**13. Explain the `reduce` method in the Stream API.**

**Answer:** The `reduce` method in the Stream API is used to perform a reduction operation on the elements of a Stream. It combines elements to produce a single result, such as summing numbers or finding the maximum value.

**14. What is the purpose of the `flatMap` operation in the Stream API?**

**Answer:** The `flatMap` operation is used to transform and flatten elements of a Stream that are themselves Streams. It's commonly used for handling nested collections or maps.

**15. How do you handle optional values in Java 8?**

**Answer:** Java 8 introduced the `Optional` class to handle potentially null values more effectively. It encourages developers to explicitly handle the presence or absence of a value.

**16. What are the different types of collectors available in Java 8 for Stream operations?**

**Answer:** Java 8 provides collectors like `Collectors.toList()`, `Collectors.toSet()`, `Collectors.joining()`, and more for collecting Stream elements into different data structures or aggregations.

**17. Explain the concept of a parallel Stream in Java 8.**

**Answer:** A parallel Stream is a Stream that can perform operations concurrently on multiple threads, potentially improving performance for CPU-bound tasks. You can create a parallel Stream using the `parallelStream()` method.

**18. What is the purpose of the `Supplier` functional interface in Java 8?**

**Answer:** The `Supplier` functional interface is used to represent a supplier of results. It doesn't take any arguments but produces a result when invoked.

**19. How does Java 8 handle default methods in interfaces to avoid conflicts in multiple inheritance scenarios?**

**Answer:** Java 8 resolves conflicts in multiple inheritance scenarios by following the rule that a subclass method always overrides an interface default method.

**20. Explain the purpose of the `peek` method in the Stream API.**

**Answer:** The `peek` method is used for performing an action on each element of a Stream while retaining the original elements. It is often used for debugging or logging purposes.

**21. What are the advantages of using the Stream API for processing collections?**

**Answer:** Advantages include concise code, functional-style programming, support for parallelism, and improved readability.

**22. What is the difference between `findFirst()` and `findAny()` in the Stream API?**

**Answer:** `findFirst()` returns the first element in a Stream, while `findAny()` returns any element in the Stream. `findAny()` is often used in parallel Stream operations.

**23. Explain the purpose of the `ofNullable` method in the `Optional` class in Java 8.**

**Answer:** `ofNullable` is used to create an `Optional` with a non-null value or an empty `Optional` if the value is null. It avoids `NullPointerExceptions` when working with potentially null values.

**

24. What is the purpose of the `tryAdvance` method in the `Spliterator` interface in Java 8?**

**Answer:** The `tryAdvance` method is used to perform one iteration over an element, returning `true` if there's another element or `false` if the end of the data source is reached.

**25. How does the `zoneId` work in the `java.time` package for handling time zones?**

**Answer:** The `zoneId` is used to represent a time zone. It allows you to perform date and time operations in a specific time zone, ensuring accurate handling of time-related data.

These questions cover various aspects of Java 8, including its new features, functional programming concepts, and enhancements to core Java libraries. Be prepared to discuss these topics and demonstrate your understanding in interviews.


In Java, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, and `Predicate` are three common functional interfaces from the `java.util.function` package that are used for various tasks in functional programming. These interfaces allow you to pass behavior as arguments, return behavior from methods, and perform operations on data in a functional style. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **Consumer (`java.util.function.Consumer<T>`):**
   - A `Consumer` is a functional interface that represents an operation that takes a single input argument of type `T` and returns no result (i.e., it consumes the input).
   - It provides a `void accept(T t)` method to perform the operation on the input.
   - Common use cases include iterating over a collection and performing an action on each element, logging, or modifying objects in place.

   ```java
   Consumer<String> printUpperCase = s -> System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
   printUpperCase.accept("hello"); // Prints "HELLO"
   ```

2. **Supplier (`java.util.function.Supplier<T>`):**
   - A `Supplier` is a functional interface that represents a supplier of results (i.e., it produces a result of type `T`).
   - It provides a `T get()` method to retrieve the result.
   - Common use cases include lazy initialization, generating random values, or providing a constant value.

   ```java
   Supplier<Double> randomValue = () -> Math.random();
   double value = randomValue.get(); // Retrieves a random value
   ```

3. **Predicate (`java.util.function.Predicate<T>`):**
   - A `Predicate` is a functional interface that represents a boolean-valued function that takes an input argument of type `T` and returns a boolean result.
   - It provides a `boolean test(T t)` method to perform the test.
   - Common use cases include filtering elements based on a condition, validating input, or checking for certain properties.

   ```java
   Predicate<Integer> isEven = n -> n % 2 == 0;
   boolean result = isEven.test(4); // Returns true
   ```

These functional interfaces are used extensively when working with Java streams, allowing you to express operations on data in a clear and concise manner. They are an essential part of functional programming in Java and help improve code readability and maintainability by encapsulating behavior and promoting a more declarative style of programming.
