1. **What is Spring Boot, and why is it used?**
   
   **Answer:** Spring Boot is a framework in the Spring ecosystem that simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications. It provides sensible defaults, auto-configuration, embedded web servers, and a wide range of libraries, making it easier to build production-ready applications with minimal effort.

2. **What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?**

   **Answer:** Spring is a comprehensive framework for building Java applications, while Spring Boot is a project within the Spring ecosystem that simplifies the development of Spring applications by providing convention-based configurations and reducing boilerplate code.

3. **Explain the purpose of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.**

   **Answer:** `@SpringBootApplication` is a meta-annotation that combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It marks the main class of a Spring Boot application and triggers Spring Boot's auto-configuration and component scanning.

4. **What is Spring Boot Starter?**

   **Answer:** A Spring Boot Starter is a pre-configured set of dependencies that simplifies the setup of specific functionalities in a Spring Boot application. Starters include libraries, dependencies, and sensible defaults for common use cases.

5. **How can you externalize configuration in a Spring Boot application?**

   **Answer:** Configuration properties can be externalized using properties files (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`), environment variables, or command-line arguments. Spring Boot uses a specific hierarchy to resolve property values, giving higher precedence to command-line arguments.
